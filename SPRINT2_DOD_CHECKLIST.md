# Sprint 2 Definition of Done Checklist

## Functional
- [x] Dynamic PageRenderer renders placements with responsive spans
- [x] Component registry supports lazy loading without runtime errors
- [x] Hydration hook returns assetsMap/componentsMap/placements consistently
- [x] Skeleton states appear during initial load and component suspense
- [x] Telemetry events collected & optionally POST to /metrics toggleable
- [x] Theme tokens editable & persisted; CSS vars applied (server fetch + local overrides)
- [x] API key panel validates and status indicator visible in navbar
- [x] Transform Builder & Function Editor placeholders accessible via routes

## Quality
- [ ] Lint passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [x] No console errors in basic navigation (manual spot check)
- [x] Error boundary catches thrown component errors
- [x] Basic a11y: skip link, focus outlines, tab roles, aria labels on nav buttons

## Performance
- [x] Initial bundle excludes non-rendered lazy components
- [x] Telemetry durations recorded for all apiRequest calls

## Security
- [x] API key stored only in localStorage (not embedded in code)
- [x] Correlation IDs generated per request
- [x] Retry logic bounded (exponential with cap)

## Documentation
- [x] ARCHITECTURE.md updated with rendering pipeline & future roadmap
- [x] Checklist updated and reviewed (this file)

## Follow-up Items for Sprint 3 (Draft)
- [ ] Persisted metrics storage & retention policy
- [ ] Live transform editing & persistence
- [ ] Plugin/remote component manifest loading
- [ ] Enhanced accessibility audit (WCAG color contrast automation)
- [ ] Unit tests for hooks (hydration, telemetry buffer)
- [ ] E2E smoke via Cypress for dynamic page load
- [ ] Theming versioning & dark mode token set
